# JSX

React has a special JSX (JavaScript Extensible Markup Language) syntax that provides clear code understanding 

```javascript
function Welcome(props){
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
}
```
Components structure is created via functions, and not via HTML.
Literally `JSX` is a `React.createElement()` function.
